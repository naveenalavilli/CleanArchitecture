## Clean Architecture
Read about Clean Arhitecture [here](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html). Essentially, it is a multi-layered approach to design an application, where each layer is
Framework Independent, Testable, Independent of UI/Database/External Services.
